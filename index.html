            <h1>Carpet Crawlers</h1>
            <p>There bs wool under my naked feet<br>
                The wool is soft and warm<br>
                Gives off some kind of heat<br>
                A salamander scurries into fame to be destroyed<br>
                Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid<br>
                The fleas cling to the golden fleece<br>
                Hoping they'll find peace<br>
                Each thought and gesture are caught in Celluloid<br>
                There's no hiding in my memory<br>
                There's no room to avoid<br>
                The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor<br>
                For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before<br>
                They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door<br>
                Where the needle's eye is winking, closing on the poor<br>
                The carpet crawlers heed their callers<br>
                We've got to get in to get out<br>
                We've got to get in to get out<br>
                We've got to get in to get out<br>
                There's only one direction in the faces that I seeâ€¦</p>
